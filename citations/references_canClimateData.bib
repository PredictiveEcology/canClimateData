	abstract = {1. Climate change research often relies on downscaled general circulation models (GCM), projections of future scenarios that are used to build ecological and evolutionary models. With more than 35 different GCMs widely available at a resolution of 10 km and finer, standardized methods to understand the differences among GCM projections in a region of interest and to choose which GCM to use for analysis are essential to maximize relevance to policy and to assure a proper treatment of uncertainty.
	2. To help researchers and policymakers understand and select form the range of available GCM scenarios, we have developed GCM compareR, an open‐source web application written in R using shiny. GCM compareR is freely accessible with an easy interactive user interface, has preloaded climate scenario data to increase the speed of analysis and is fully documented to ensure reproducibility. Users of the application need no prior experience in coding.
	3. GCM compareR is designed to compare GCMs and different climate change scenarios to provide full, documented exploration of the possible alternative futures from within the range of projections in CMIP5 climate models. Designed with a wide group of users in mind, including ecologists, conservationists and policymakers, the application is designed to adapt analyses to any geographic area of interest. Results are provided as figures, tables and maps that clearly communicate the differences among model projections for the region. Additionally, the tool allows for the export of a report that records the parameter choices and results of a session, along with contextual information, to make the analysis fully transparent and replicable.},

	abstract = {Use of downscaled global climate model projections is expanding rapidly as climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning become mainstream in many sectors. Many climate change impact analyses use climate model projections downscaled at very high spatial resolution (~1 km) but very low temporal resolution (20- to 30-year normals). These applications have model selection priorities that are distinct from analyses at high temporal resolution. Here, we select a 13-model ensemble and an 8-model subset designed for robust change-factor downscaling of monthly climate normals, and describe their attributes in North America. All models are selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) archives. The 13-model ensemble is representative of the distribution of equilibrium climate sensitivity, grid resolution, and transient regional climate changes in the CMIP6 generation. The 8-model subset is consistent with the IPCC's recent assessment of the very likely range of Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity. Our results emphasize several principles for selection and use of downscaled climate ensembles: (a) the ensemble must be observationally constrained to be meaningful; (b) analysis of multiple models is essential as the ensemble mean alone can be misleading; (c) small (<8-member) ensembles should be region-specific and used with caution; (d) higher grid resolution is not necessarily better; and (e) multiple simulations of each model/scenario combination are necessary to represent precipitation uncertainty. Although we have focused our documentation on North America, our model selection uses primarily global criteria and is applicable to downscaling climate normals in other continents. Downscaled projections for the selected models are available in ClimateNA (http://climatena.ca/). An accompanying web application (https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/cmip6-NA/) provides tools for further model selection and visualization of the ensemble.},
